# Testing & Validation Instructions

## Testing Approach

- Use the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach for all code changes.
- Write unit tests before implementing new features or changes.
- Iterate, cycling between writing tests and code until the feature is complete.
- Coverage should be substantial, aiming for at least 80% coverage.
- Always run `dotnet build` before suggesting changes are complete
- Use `dotnet test` for unit test validation  
- Test Docker builds with `docker build` when Dockerfile changes are made
