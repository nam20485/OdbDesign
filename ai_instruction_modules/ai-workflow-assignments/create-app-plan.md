### Assignment

Your assignment is to create a new application plan based on a filled-out application template. This involves systematic analysis of requirements, careful implementation following established guidelines, and delivery of a application plan that meets all specified criteria.

The application template can be found in the docs/ directory in a file called ai-new-app-template.md. The supporting files are linked to in that file and are also included in the same directory. It contains all the necessary details about the application you need to create the plan for, including features, components, and requirements.

Specifically, you will:

1. Analyze the filled-out application template and linked supporting documents to understand requirements and expectations and then use the task-based workflow process to create the application.

**Always follow instructions given here (generally) and specifically as described in the task-based workflow process.**

It is important to the final quality of our product for everyone to perform their assignment exactly as specified.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Analyze the Application Template**
   - Review the provided application template and any linked documents
   - Identify all requirements, features, and components that need to be implemented
   - Understand the technology stack and design principles to be followed

2. **Design Plan**
   - Create a detailed design plan based on the template
   - Define the project structure, including directories, files, and naming conventions
   - Identify necessary frameworks, tools, and packages to be used
   - Plan for testing, documentation, containerization, and other mandatory requirements
   - Create Issue documenting plan and iterate to gain approval from the orchestrator or stakeholders


### Completion

Ask the stake-holder if they are happy with the plan and can approve it. If not then make the requested changes and iterate asking for approval and making changes until approval is gained.
Ask the stake-holder for your next assignment.
