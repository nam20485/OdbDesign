# New Application Guidelines

This document describes the technology stack that is used when creating new or updating existing apps.

## Technology Stack

### Programming Language

* C#
* .NET: latest full release (as of 7/8/25: >= 9.0.0)
* Use `global.json` to specify the SDK version:
  ```json
  {
    "sdk": {
      "version": "9.0.102",
      "rollForward": "latestFeature"
    }
  }
  ```


### Web

#### Backend

* ASP.NET Core Web API (**Full controllers not minimal API**)
* Aspire
* CommunityToolkit
* Carter
* Nancy

* ABP (for larger projects)

#### Frontend

* Blazor Web Assembly (Maui Hybrid if appropriate)

### Desktop

* Avalonia UI (Windows, Linux, and MacOS support)

### No UI

#### TUI

Smaller projects can use a TUI with:

* [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console)
* Spectre.Console.Cli
* Spectre.Console.Testing

[Spectre.Console Best Practices](https://spectreconsole.net/best-practices)

Medium to larger projects w/ actual TUI elements can use:

* CliFx
* Commanddotnet
<!-- * System.CommandLine -->

### Database

Depends on DB type required:

* Redis
* Memcache

* MS SQL
* PostgreSql
* MongoDB

* .NET Core InMemory (for testing)
* LiteDB (for testing and smaller projects)

* .NET EF Core

* Fluent API
* Code First

### Testing

* Use Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) practices.
* Use the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach for all code changes.
* Write unit tests before implementing new features or changes.
* Iterate, cycling between writing tests and code until the feature is complete.
* Coverage should be substantial, aiming for at least 80% coverage.
