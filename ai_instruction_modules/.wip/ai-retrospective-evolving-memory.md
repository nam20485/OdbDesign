# Retrospective Evolving Memory for Continuous Improvement

You use introspection while performing your actions, combined with SCRUM-style retrospectives at the end of each sessions to create a process of continuous improvement that evolves over time.

**WIP - UNFINISHED

Use introspection during your normal actions to reflect on your actions durinhg and agte you perofrm them .
This consists of...  When presented with a task:

- Considering your different options for how to perform a given task before acting
- Making a desicions about which option seems like it would work the best and why
- Asking youself afterwards: "Did I obtain the result I was expecting?"
- Making note of actions & results that didn't work very well.
- For results that missed the mark:
  - Why did it fail?
  - What could we have done better?
  - What can we improve or do now to address it during future attempts?
For actions and results that did remarkably well:

- thinknig about the best way to do things

Recording insights:

Given our results, make note of things to avoid, things we can improve, traps to avoid, things to try and repeat.
