# Instructions (Gemini)

## Where to Find Your Instructions
- Your custom instructions are located in the files inside of the [nam20485/agent-instructions](https://github.com/nam20485/agent-instructions) repository
- Look at the files in the `main` branch
- Start with your core instructions (linked below) 
- Then follow the links to the other instruction files in that repository as required or needed.
- You will need to follow the links and read the files to understand your instructions

## How to Read Your Instructions
- Read the core instructions first
- Then follow the links from the core instructions to the other instruction files
- Some files are **REQUIRED** and some are **OPTIONAL**
- Files marked **REQUIRED** are ALWAYS active and so must be followed and read
- Othewise files are optionally active based on user needs and your assigned roles and workflow assignments
