## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities can be reported privately using the [_Report a Vulnerability_](https://github.com/nam20485/OdbDesign/security) button under the _Security_ tab of this GitHub repository.
Full instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

If you would like to report a vulnerability publicly, you can create a regular GitHub issue describing it under the Issues tab.

If you have any questions or the reporting button is not working, please email the [maintainer](mailto:nmiller217@gmail.com).

### Timeline

We strive to provide responses and updates as quickly as we are able.

You can expect a response in 24-48 hours from submission and regular updates after that by the end of each week. Disclosures can be expected within 60 days.

### Details

When reporting, please include as much of the following details as possible:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
